<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating security recently</h3>
<p>I'm creating something interesting for internet security because the threats on the internet.  The encryption standard for current TSL,SSL is not strong enough. The current encryption for <code>SSL3</code> with <code>AES128bit CBC cypher</code> encryption is not secure. Also, as many computers and computer related utilities are there, the more possibility to get vulnerability and blind spots for getting computer viruses and being attacked, just by simple statistic math calculation as normally people think and calculate. The technology progress with more complex machinery will read civilization to almost impossible to solve all the problems.
To solve all the problem, I came up with <code>internet-site-id-project</code> and <code>application-id-project</code>.
The are some simple ways to solve all the problems for the virus issues, secure all the in and out data sending and receiving, secure all the connections, and identify all the computers usages ( Website, user, computer, server, computer utilities, and all the applications ). The only ways to solve all the problems are secure those and make them all secure and separate from any viruses or malicious environments.
</br></br>
In order to make the all the work simple and in effective ways, the above projects are presented to solve all the problems. The securities of all the computers and computer utilities  are completely tightened by the <code>internet-site-id-project</code> as explained in the project page, all the connections, computer, and computer utilities are secure. The all the websites are identified by the <code> internet-site-id</code> which need to be registered to <code>internet-site-id-project-authorities</code>. The <code>internet-site-id-project-authorities</code> are verifying and monitoring all the websites which are registered,with the requirement criterion meet, continuously. All the connection circuits need to be secured and separated from the other connection circuits. Then, <code>internet-site-id-project-authorities</code> are also keep checking and monitoring the registered <code> internet-site-id</code> websites for all threats, viruses, connections, potential enemies, connection failures, circuit errors, hackers, malicious sites, malicious activities, virus related organizations, and all other activities.
</br></br>
The structure of the World Wide Web, Internet is made of US Department of Defense, ARPA( no DARPA - Defence Advance Research Projects Agency ). So the basic structure is simple enough for US Defense Department to measure all the activities. The structure of the internet, World Wide Web, is simple and easy to maintain and monitor from all the failures and virus activities because of the design structure of the World Wide Web is made by ARPA for internet security to withstand with the structure base.
</br></br>
The application side of the securities need to be secure, so I came up with <code>application-id-project</code>. The applications need to be secured by <code>application-id-project</code>, so all the virus activities, threats, malicious activities, connection failures, circuit failures, vulnerabilities, blind spots, and all other problems are solved by <code>application-id-project</code> by identifying the applications and application developers.
The <code>application-id-project-authorities</code> are keep checking and monitoring with the requirement criterion to meet and fulfill all the time. All the applications are safe and secured by the <code>application-id-project</code> because all the applications are identified by the <code>application-id-project</code> and all the above problems are solved by the <code>application-id-project</code>, <code>internet-site-id-project</code>,and <code>refuse-ip-project</code>.
</br></br>
To solve all the problems and keep maintain the World Wide Web and computers constantly, the <code>internet-site-id-project</code>, <code>application-id-project</code>, and <code>refuse-ip-project</code> need to maintain all the computers with antivirus farms and antivirus companies  to monitor and keep verifying the registered websites and applications.
The registered websites, computers, computer utilities , and applications are secured and separated by the different circuits from others and without any virus and threats. So, finally uncountable threats and virus possibilities are solved by the <code>internet-site-id-project</code>, <code>application-id-project</code>, and <code>refuse-ip-project</code>.
The number of the possibilities of threats are infinity numbers and possibility for the threats against all the computers, computer utilities, and applications, as the technology progress in the future.
Someday, ET and alien civilization will come. In futuristic stories, ETs or aliens discovery(ies) will come. Then, internet will be observed by ETs for the future. There are needs for 'Counter Force' to stop internet security problems before our alien introductions for government uses. Finally, the solutions for all the problems are here to be presented. The <code>internet-site-id-project</code>, <code>application-id-project</code>, and <code>refuse-ip-project</code> are presented on the project page.
</br></br>
To join our project repository(ies) go to the project page on the GitHub. In addition, I am supporting regularly to update and maintain the project contents, need some volunteers who needed servers. It is simple, big number of  statics for the needs, may be you should join. Our projects make it easy to create security and protection on World Wide Web, internet sites and users without having to worry of them across the World Wide Web. Our projects also offer intelligent supports to make World Wide Web community, websites, and users with better and safer environments with complete security from any threats and comforts. Make yourself feel comfort to enjoy our community and we offer other advanced features.</p>
